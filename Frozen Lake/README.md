The Frozen Lake folder consists of a seven Python files namely:
(1) nstep_test.py -> has the code for the hyperparameter sweep for Episodic Semi-Gradient n-step SARSA algorithm
(2) reinforce_test.py -> has the code for the hyperparameter sweep for REINFORCE with Baseline algorithm
(3) ac_test.py -> has the code for the hyperparameter sweep for One-Step Actor-Critic algorithm
(4) nstep_sarsa_frozenlake.py -> has the code for Episodic Semi-Gradient n-step SARSA algorithm
(5) reinforce_baseline_frozenlake.py -> has the code for REINFORCE with Baseline algorithm
(6) actor_critic_frozenlake.py -> has the code for One-Step Actor-Critic algorithm
(7) plot.py -> has the code to generate the plot combining all three learning curves


In order to run these code just open the folder in a Code Editor IDE like Visual Studio Code and simply run the respective code file the results for the Frozen Lake section of this project.
