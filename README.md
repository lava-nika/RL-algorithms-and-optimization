# Reinforcement Learning Algorithms and Optimization

This repository contains implementation of a set of reinforcement learning algorithms on each of 3 benchmark environments from OpenAI’s Gymnasium library. Systematic comparison of their learning behaviors and final performance have been performed.

## Environments and Algorithms

### (A) Frozen Lake
- Episodic Semi-Gradient *n*-step SARSA  
- REINFORCE with Baseline  
- One-Step Actor-Critic  

### (B) Mountain Car
- Episodic Semi-Gradient *n*-step SARSA  
- REINFORCE with Baseline  
- One-Step Actor-Critic  

### (C) CartPole
- PI²-CMA-ES + Tiles  
- Episodic Semi-Gradient *n*-step SARSA  
- REINFORCE with Baseline  
- One-Step Actor-Critic  


## Folder structure:
1. CartPole -> consists of all the code files required to reproduce results on the CartPole environment.
2. Frozen Lake -> consists of all the code files required to reproduce results on the Frozen Lake environment.
3. Mountain Car -> consists of all the code files required to reproduce results on the Mountain Car environment.
